FLUID 3D

Aims
- 3D simulation of fluids down to fs timescales
- GPU parallelisation
- Accurate laser interactions
- Error calculations
- Molecular simulation, with each molecule representing a variable number of chemical molecules

Development plan
- Create functioning 3D fluid
- Once a basic fluid can be created, get unit tests and continous integration working
- Conservation of mass, energy, momentum
- Simulate dropping a water droplet onto a hard surface
- Simulate shock waves travelling through a fluid
- Work on laser interactions

Physical equations
- Lagrangian framework
